# Organization Profile Repository

This repository contains the source for our organization's GitHub profile README.

The `profile/README.md` is automatically updated every week with a list of our public repositories, thanks to a GitHub Action defined in `.github/workflows/update-readme.yml`.

For more details, see the `update_readme.py` script.
